I will get to working on this soon. This is to prevent having a data structure taking up incredible amounts of space (~16GB). |
| October 30 |   9-10:30am   | I created a bucket class to make a map of sorts to hold the values. There still may be some collisions, but it seems good so far. During tutorial, I talked with you about horner's method and I rewrote my hash function so it worked properly. I began reading in the data, but I still need to make sure I am not referencing null objects. I'm feeling pretty good so far about this first attempt. |
| October 30 | 10:45-11:15pm |                                                            I fixed a little here. Overall, I got both the IP and Stock tests to work, but the elements and products weren't. I think it might be due to collisions so I tried a bunch of differnet primes. None of them worked. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this first attempt, and I'm excited to see what new strategy we'll learn about soon. |
