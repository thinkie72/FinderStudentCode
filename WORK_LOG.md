| October 25   |  11:25-11:55pm  |                                                                                                                                                                             I discussed with my peers and you about using TSTs to store these huge dataset possibilities. I will get to working on this soon. This is to prevent having a data structure taking up incredible amounts of space (~16GB). |
| October 30   |    9-10:30am    | I created a bucket class to make a map of sorts to hold the values. There still may be some collisions, but it seems good so far. During tutorial, I talked with you about horner's method and I rewrote my hash function so it worked properly. I began reading in the data, but I still need to make sure I am not referencing null objects. I'm feeling pretty good so far about this first attempt. |
| October 30   |  10:45-11:15pm  |                                                            I fixed a little here. Overall, I got both the IP and Stock tests to work, but the elements and products weren't. I think it might be due to collisions so I tried a bunch of differnet primes. None of them worked. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this first attempt, and I'm excited to see what new strategy we'll learn about soon. |
| November 4   |  12:45-1:45pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                               I created a HashMap class to start the liner probing. I haven't tested it yet but I think I'm close. I still need to make the Finder class work with my changes. Hoping to finish soon... |
| November 5   |    9:30-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I'm feeling pretty close. I figured out how to make linear probing work. And my IPs work, but my others don't. I'm hoping I can figure this out tomorrow during class. |
| November 7/8 | 11:30pm-12:15am |                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of work here. I realized I could just use my original add method, and that my issues were because of overflow within my hash function. I decreased the radix and it worked great. I commented and finished. |
